Knitting
========

A toolkit inspired by http://alliejon.es/blog/2014/03/24/adding-syntax-highlighting-to-knitting-patterns/. Instead of just syntax highlighting I intend to go much further with full parsing of the informal language of knitting instructions, and when that is done I intend to create a new visualization of knitting that combines the written and diagrammatic forms. Maybe also just outputting the diagram form when you have the text.
